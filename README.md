# i3-Market Semantic Models

Repository for sharing and managing models files

One of The main contribution of the Data Models / Ontologies  is to enable the mapping of the data assets, provided from i3-Market stakeholders, to the model/”ontology” concepts to capture the structural and semantic characteristics metadata of the various entities in each data asset = Data Offering. More specifically, the core uses of this model are for: 1) data Registration on mapping which corresponds to the data harmonization process. In this way, each provided data asset will be registered in our Registry with concepts from the i3-Market data offering model in a semi-automatic way; 2) metadata linking where any provided data asset metadata will be linked with other relevant sources (or data assets) that exist in Backplane; 3) data Discovery which involves the development of algorithms and software for supporting the selection of the most appropriate metadata data assets that best match user preferences. 
The i3-Market Models will be used for capturing the structural and semantic characteristics of the various entities involved in the i3-Market backplane domain, whereas the underlying conceptual models facilitate the use of lightweight reasoning during the discovery and operational process e.g. for contracts and service/agreements operations..


Model Coding: The representation of the ontology capture was transformed into a
formal (ontology) language (e.g. OWL) using Protégé.
I. Top-level Ontology: Create a top-level ontology that describes the main high level concepts and links for the i3-Market backplane domain
II. Integrating Existing sub topic Ontologies: Use existing related domains ontologies and  incorporate them under the top-level ontology.
III. Expanding the Domain-level use-cases pilots categories/annotations: Expand (Build-on-top) the domain-level conceptSkeme categorization taxonomies and include the new concepts, data fields and relationships between the concepts that were extracted from the demonstrators’ domains.
